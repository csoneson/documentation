## Getting started

The main advantage of the Omnibenchmark project is its **modularity**: components can be easily added to the data, methods or metrics modules. 

The following sections will explain how to bring such extensions. If you are interested in adding modules to omnibenchmark, it is required that:

1. you have a valid account to access `Renku <https://renkulab.io/>`_ 

2. you have a script for you data, method or metric.
