This section is dedicated for **module contributors**, basic users that would like to add a new module (dataset, method, metric) to an existing Omnibenchmark. This section will show how to add a new module to an existing Omnibenchmark. 

This section will **not** show you how to create/ setup an Omnibenchmark (see the `Benchmarker` section) and how to visualize and interpret the evaluation results (see the `Method user` section).
