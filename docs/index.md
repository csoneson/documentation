## Welcome to Omnibenchmark documentation

**Omnibenchmark** is a benchmark project that aims to provide
**community-driven**, **modular**, **extensible** and **always
up-to-date** benchmarks.

It is based on the [Renku project](https://renkulab.io/), an open and
collaborative data analysis platform.

The framework connects **data**, **methods** and **metrics**
repositories (a.k.a. *modules*), that can be flexibly extended by any
community member.

If you are interested in contributing a new **method**, **dataset** or
**metric**, follow the documentation from the
`Getting started` section, where you can
learn more about how omnibenchmark works and how to extend it with a new
module.

If you are interested in exploring one of the existing benchmarks and
the latest results, you can directly jump to the results of our
evaluations in the `Output` section.
